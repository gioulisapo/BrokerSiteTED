        <p>Real estate is "property consisting of land and the buildings on it, along with its natural resources such as crops, minerals, or water;
            immovable property of this nature; an interest vested in this; (also) an item of real property;(more generally) buildings or
             housing in general. Also: the business of real estate; the profession of buying, selling, or renting land, buildings or housing.
            It is a legal term used in jurisdictions such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Nigeria, Australia, and New Zealand."</p>
        <p>The legal arrangement for the right to occupy a dwelling in some countries is known as the housing tenure. Types of housing tenure
            include owner occupancy, tenancy, housing cooperative, condominiums (individually parceled properties in a single building), public housing,
            squatting, and cohousing. The occupants of a residence constitute a household.Residences can be classified by, if, and how they are connected
            to neighboring residences and land. Different types of housing tenure can be used for the same physical type. For example, connected residents
            might be owned by a single entity and leased out, or owned separately with an agreement covering the relationship between units and common areas and concerns.

        <h3>Major categories in North America and Europe.</h3>
        <ul>
            
            <li>Attached / multi-unit dwellings</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Apartment – An individual unit in a multi-unit building. The boundaries of the apartment are generally defined by a
                perimeter of locked or lockable doors. Often seen in multi-story apartment buildings.</li>
                <li>Multi-family house – Often seen in multi-story detached buildings, where each floor is a separate apartment or unit.</li>
                <li>Terraced house (a. k. a. townhouse or rowhouse) – A number of single or multi-unit buildings in a continuous row with shared walls and no intervening space.</li>
                <li>Condominium – Building or complex, similar to apartments, owned by individuals. Common grounds and common areas within the complex are owned and shared jointly.
                    There are townhouse or rowhouse style condominiums as well.</li>
                <li>Cooperative (a. k. a. co-op) – A type of multiple ownership in which the residents of a multi-unit housing complex own shares in
                the cooperative corporation that owns the property, giving each resident the right to occupy a specific apartment or unit.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>The size of an apartment or house can be described in square feet or meters. In the United States, this includes the area of
            “living space”, excluding the garage and other non-living spaces. The “square meters” figure of a house in Europe may report the
            total area of the walls enclosing the home, thus including any attached garage and non-living spaces, which makes it important
            to inquire what kind of surface definition has been used.It can be described more roughly by the number of rooms. A studio apartment
            has a single bedroom with no living room (possibly a separate kitchen). A one-bedroom apartment has a living or dining room separate from the bedroom.
            Two bedroom, three bedroom, and larger units are common. (A bedroom is defined as a room with a closet for clothes storage.)</p>
